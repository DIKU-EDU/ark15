This is the first in a series of three G-assignments ("G" for "Godkendelse"
and/or "Gruppeopgave") which you must pass in order to be eligible for the exam
in the course http://www.webcitation.org/6a2I3GpLv[Machine Architecture (ARK)]
at http://www.diku.dk[DIKU]. We encourage
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming[pair programming], so please
form groups of 2-3 students.

[.lead]
Although this G-assignment is fairly self-contained, we strongly
encourage you to at least skim the first two chapters of <<COD>>, as well as
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/HP_AppA.pdf[Appendices A.1 to A.6]. You will
find it extremely convenient to have

Happy hacking :-)

////
The intent of this G-assignment is to gain hands-on experience with basic C
programming, and to have a go at simulating MIPS32 instructions.

You will learn to:

* assemble basic MIPS32 assembly into machine code;
* read and interpret MIPS32 machine code in C; and
* simulate a simple, single-core MIPS32 processor.

The C-skills you will practice can perhaps be summarised as follows:

* writing, compiling, and executing programs written in C;
* simple preprocessor macros in C;
* conditionals and switch statements;
* basic arrays and pointers to simple types; as well as
* logical, binary, and arithmetic operators in C.

The simulator we consider here is very basic. In popular nomenclature, we
simulate a MIPS32 processor which does not perform pipelined, or speculative
execution, has no caches, and has only one processor core. Many of these
topics, and more, will be explored in excruciating detail in G2 and G3.
////

== Assignment

This is a short overview of your assignment. Flip back to this if you are ever
in doubt about what you are doing.

Your task is to write a simulator for a subset of the MIPS32 ISA. The simulator
must be written in C. It must support the following MIPS instructions: `addu`,
`addiu`, `and`, `andi`, `beq`, `bne`, `j`, `jal`, `jr`, `lw`, `nor`, `or`,
`ori`, `sll`, `slti`, `slt`, `srl`, `subu`, `sw`, and halt when it sees a
`syscall` instruction.

The simulator must take two command-line arguments: A configuration file, and
an executable ELF file. The configuration file contains the initial values for
the registers `t0`-`t7`. The values are written as ASCII integers, no bigger
than would fit in a `uint32_t`.  For instance, if we want `t5` to be
initialized to the value `42`, we should be able to provide a configuration
file that looks like this:

----
0
0
0
0
42
0
0
----

After simulating the program in the given ELF file, the simulator should print
the number of instructions executed and the contents of the most interesting
registers in hex. The output must must be in the following "printf syntax":

----
Executed %zu instruction(s).
pc = 0x%x
at = 0x%x
v0 = 0x%x
v1 = 0x%x
t0 = 0x%x
t1 = 0x%x
t2 = 0x%x
t3 = 0x%x
t4 = 0x%x
t5 = 0x%x
t6 = 0x%x
t7 = 0x%x
sp = 0x%x
ra = 0x%x
----

OBS! Please follow this format precisely as your code will be subject to
automated testing.

For the configuration given above, and a program that contains _just_ the
`syscall` instruction, your simulator must halt with the following output:

----
Ran 1 instructions(s).
pc = 0x0
at = 0x0
v0 = 0x0
v1 = 0x0
t0 = 0x0
t1 = 0x0
t2 = 0x0
t3 = 0x0
t4 = 0x0
t5 = 0x2a
t6 = 0x0
t7 = 0x0
sp = 0x0
ra = 0x0
----

Lastly, follow the instructions in <<_submitting_your_solution>>.

== Introduction

We begin with the exact same introduction (except for the last section) as in
our tutorial on
https://github.com/onlineta/ark15/blob/master/tutorials/linux-toolchains-and-assembly.asciidoc[Linux,
Toolchains, and Assembly]. We assume in the rest of this assignment that you
have completed this tutorial.

An executable file is a series of instructions, called machine code, packed
into a format that your operating system (Linux, OS X, Windows, etc.)
understands.  Machine code itself is __architecture dependent__: its precise
format depends on the __instruction set architecture__ for which it is
intended.  Your own machine is probably an
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64[x86-64] or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture[ARM] architecture, whereas in
this course, we will study a variant of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_Instruction_Set[MIPS instruction set]: MIPS
processors thrive in network routers and video game consoles.

Machine code is a series of bits which are understood by a CPU. Dealing with
bits is not very programmer friendly. An XKCD comic puts text editors and bits
into perspective:

.XKCD: Real Programmers (source: http://xkcd.com/378/).
image::http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/real_programmers.png[align="center"]

Assembly language instructions are textual mnemonics (representations) for
sequences of bits.  Writing assembly is the closest to the hardware a
programmer usually gets. Like machine code, assembly code is architecture
dependent.

Assembly language is translated into machine code by an __assembler__.  Higher
level languages, such as C, are usually architecture __independent__, and code
is converted into machine code (sometimes, assembly code) by a __compiler__.

The machine code is read into main memory upon execution. Small, fast CPU
registers contain fixed-size bit-sequences, and are used for executing
individual instructions: machine instructions operate on registers. In MIPS32,
registers are 32 bits wide. We say that instructions operate on 32-bit
__words__.

Computation on values in memory means that values must be explicitly read from
memory into registers, and explicitly written from registers to memory. This
wastes precious clock cycles. Working with memory is significantly slower than
working exclusively with registers.

In MIPS32, there are 32 __general-purpose__ registers. There are also a couple
of __special-purpose__ registers. The Program Counter (PC) register, contains
the memory address of the instruction to be executed next.  Instructions in
MIPS32 are always one word, or 32 bits wide. Memory on the other hand, is
addressed in bytes, that is, in terms of 8-bit sequences. After each
instruction is executed, the PC must therefore be incremented by 4 to point to
the immediately following instruction.

The exact format of an instruction depends upon the type of operation being
carried out, but the most significant 6 bits always denote the "opcode", which
designates the type of instruction to be executed. The rest of the bits making
up the instruction contain register numbers, partial memory addresses, or
additional parameters for the instruction.

=== Assembly and Linking

////
Symbols corresponding to labels can be defined within assembly code. These
provide references to the memory addresses of places in the code. These
references are used by branch and jump instructions, which correspond to
conditionals such as if, and goto respectively.
////

An assembler assembles assembly code into an __object file__. An object file is
not directly executable, but it begins with a header, providing information
about the remaining contents of the file. The contents may include:

* A text section containing the machine code.

* A (static) data section containing the data that must persist throughout the
lifetime of a program.

* Relocation information, allowing the text and data segments to be moved
around in memory.

* A symbol table, matching externally visible labels to machine code addresses.

The format of an object file (the way the file is structured) varies across
operating systems. For Linux, this is typically the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format[Executable and
Linkable Format], or ELF.

One or more object files can be linked together by a __linker__. A linker
resolves internal references within an object file, and externally, to other
files. A linker produces a file that your operating system knows how to
execute. As you might have guessed, for Linux, this is typically also the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format[Executable and
Linkable Format], or ELF.

////
Linking may include relocating code in memory, which requires
information about which instructions depend upon absolute addresses.
////

Similar to an object file, an executable file begins with a header, and may
contain, among other things, a text and data segment. The header provides
information on how to set up the memory before executing the program: how to
place the text and data segments for all branches, jumps, and loads to work
correctly.  The header also lists the address of the __entry point__
instruction. This is the instruction which will be executed first.

If all this seems mysterious to you, take a look at the
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/HP_AppA.pdf[Appendices A.1 to A.5] in <<COD>>.

=== Compiling

A compiler for a high-level language, e.g. C, produces either an assembly-,
object-, or executable file.

=== Simulation

Simulation is the imitation of the operation of some real-world system on
another system.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture_simulator[Computer
architecture simulation] is often used in connection with computer architecture
design to measure the costs and benefits of various design choices, without
putting the decisions down in silicon. The task of taking a __new__ computer
architecture from design to physical chip, requires a substantial amount of
money, manpower, and months of hard work. Software simulators, on the other
hand, are quick to write and easy to change.

In this course, we will study the MIPS32 instruction set. The machine you are
using to read (or used to print) this text is likely an x86-64 or ARM
architecture. To execute MIPS32 instructions on your machine, you will need a
simulator: a piece of software that imitates the operation of MIPS32
instructions using your native x86-64 or ARM instructions. You won't write the
simulator in x86-64 or ARM assembly—that too is a matter of months of hard
work. Instead, you will write it in C.

You have already heard of some simulators. Last week, we used the
http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/[MARS MIPS Simulator] to play
around with MIPS32 assembly. Appendix A in <<COD>> refers to another simulator,
called http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/[SPIM]. Until you have a
functioning simulator of your own, we recommend that you continue to use the
MARS MIPS simulator when playing around with MIPS32 assembly.

== Writing Your Simulator

=== Start With The Handout

Download and unpack the handed out
http://static.ark15.onlineta.org/g1-handout-v1.0.tar.gz[g1-handout-v1.0.tar.gz]
archive.

"link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)[tar]" is a classic
archiving format on Unix-like systems. An archiving format packs multiple files
and directories into one file.  "link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip[gz]"
stands to signify that the archive is also compressed. Another archiving and
compression format you might be familiar with is the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)[ZIP] file format.

The archive contains the following files and directories:

. `mips32.h` with some very useful MIPS32 macros.

. A simple ELF file parsing module in `elf.h` and `elf.c`.

. A default configuration file, `default.cfg`, for your simulator.

. A folder `asm` with a couple of MIPS32 assembly test programs and a Makefile.
Once in the folder, type `make` to build MIPS ELF executables from the assembly
source files.

. A folder `c` with a simple C test program, and a Makefile. Once in the
folder, type `make` to build MIPS ELF executables from the C source files.

[NOTE]
====
Makefiles are explained in detail below.
====

You can use the `tar` command-line utility to unpack the archive:

----
~/ark$ tar xvf g1-handout.tar.gz
----

=== Getting Started with C

==== Hello, World!

The `main` function is the entry point for your program. It takes two
arguments, the argument count (`argc`) and the arguments themselves as an array
of strings (`argv`).

Create a file called `sim.c`, with the following code:

.~/ark/1st/sim.c
----
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  // ...
}
----

The `main` function always returns an integer indicating whether execution went
as planned (0) or resulted in an error (any other integer).

In order to be able to read and write to files or the terminal, the library
`stdio.h` must be included. This is done using a preprocessor directive, or
"macro". The C preprocessor runs immediately before the compiler compiles the
program, and does a search-and-replace to expand all macros. Preprocessor
directives are lines starting with a `#` sign. Add the line:

.~/ark/1st/sim.c
----
#include <stdio.h>
----

above your defined `main` function. Then, replace the ellipsis with:

.~/ark/1st/sim.c
----
printf("Hello, world!\n");
return 0;
----

Your final program should now look like this:

.~/ark/1st/sim.c
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}
----

The `\n` is a control code for a new line. No code after the `return` statement
will be executed. Now compile and link:

----
~/ark/1st$ gcc -c sim.c
~/ark/1st$ gcc -o sim sim.o
----

The first command compiles `sim.c` to an object file, `sim.o`. The second
command links the object file, producing an executable. The `-o sim` flag tells
`gcc` to name the executable `sim`. The executable can now be run from the
terminal:

----
~/ark/1st$ ./sim
Hello, world!
~/ark/1st$
----

[TIP]
.Why `./sim`, and not just `sim`?
====

Normally, when you type a command in your shell and press enter, your shell
searches the directories in your `$PATH`
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable[environment variable] for an
executable file matching the name of the command. To see the content of `$PATH`
on your system, type

----
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
$
----

To see which file actually gets executed when you run a given command, use
`which`:

----
$ which gcc
/usr/bin/gcc
$ 
----

Since our simulator is not located in a directory referenced by `$PATH`, we use
the `./` prefix to tell the shell to look for a locally referenced executable.

====

==== More on Header Files

Header files have extension `.h`, and are usually used for preprocessor
definition directives, data structure definitions, and function prototypes.
Function prototypes are function definitions with no corresponding body, which
specify the __shape__ of the function. The compiler then knows to look in the
corresponding `.c`, or compiled `.o`  file for the actual implementation of the
function.

The angular brackets in the directive

----
#include <stdio.h>
----

caused the preprocessor to search system library directories for the file
`stdio.h`. To include local header files, use double quotes (`""`) instead of
chevrons (`<>`).

A header file, link:handout/mips32.h[mips32.h], containing some useful MIPS32
macros has been provided for your convenience. Add the following line at the
top of your `sim.c`:

----
#include "mips32.h"
----

When using quotes (`""`) rather than chevrons (`<>`), the C preprocessor will
first and foremost look for the header file in the local directory relative to
the including file. In our case, `~/ark/1st/sim.c`. Conversely, when using
chevrons, the C preprocessor will start by looking at the system-wide include
directories first, such as e.g. `/usr/include/`.

====

**EXERCISE**

Make sure that `sim.c` still compiles.

====

[TIP]
.Compiling directly to an executable
====
`gcc` can compile a C file directly to an executable, keeping the intermediate
object file in memory:

----
~/ark/1st$ gcc -o sim sim.c
----

Note, that we pass in the C file, not the object file as we did before.

====

==== Your Canonical Build System — `make`

`make` is a canonical command-line utility, used in Unix-like programming
environments for building software projects of all shapes and sizes. We will
only briefly mention some of the aspects of `make`. If you want to know more
about make, we can humbly recommend http://www.ploxiln.net/make.html[this
tutorial].

The `make` command revolves around the notion of a `Makefile`. Create a file
called `Makefile` in your `~/ark/1st/` directory. Start with these lines:

.~/ark/1st/Makefile
----
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Werror -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c11
----

`CC` and `CFLAGS` are now variables that can be used throughout the Makefile.
For instance, instead of writing

----
gcc -Werror -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c11 -o sim sim.c
----

in our Makefile (or in the terminal), we could now write

----
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o sim sim.c
----

in our Makefile, with the same result. This way, every time we compile, we use
the same compiler and command-line arguments. Typing out all those arguments
every time would've been laborious, non-maintainable, and error-prone.

[IMPORTANT]
.Arguments to `gcc`
====

Out of the box, the `gcc` compiler is rather naïve. It is easy to write bad
programs. Travel a bit safer by always using these flags:

. `-Werror` makes `gcc` treat all warnings as errors; the program will fail to
compile if `gcc` has any warnings to report about your code.

. `-Wall` enables all warnings; `gcc` comes with most warnings turned off; this
makes it easy to get started with `gcc`, but also easy to write bad programs.

. `-Wextra` enables additional, extra warnings.

. `-pedantic` enables even more warnings, making `gcc` almost as pedantic as
the teaching assistant who will mark your assignment.

. `-std=c11` makes `gcc` compile with the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)[C11 standard] in mind;
this is the most recent C language standard.

====

A Makefile is structured in terms of __rules__. A rule is a list of
__targets__, followed by a list of __prerequisites__, and a __recipe__.

A target is first-and-foremost a file that we build using a recipe. A recipe is
a list of shell commands. In this case, we need to build `sim`.  This target
has some __prerequisites__ (dependencies), namely `sim.c` and `mips32.h`:
Whenever we change `sim.c` or `mips32.h`, `sim` becomes outdated. (We typically
assume that system libraries, such as `stdio.h`, don't change very often, so
they don't count as dependencies.) The recipe is also used for bringing the
target __up to date__ with its prerequisites.

Add the following rule to your Makefile (below the `CC` and `CFLAGS` variables):

----
sim: mips32.h sim.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o sim sim.c
----

The general format of a `Makefile` rule goes as follows:

----
TARGETS : PREREQUISITES LINE-BREAK
TAB COMMAND LINE-BREAK
TAB COMMAND LINE-BREAK
TAB COMMAND LINE-BREAK
...
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Every line of a recipe must begin with a **tab character**.

To quote the http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction[GNU
`make` manual]: "This is an obscurity that catches the unwary."
====

Now try typing `make` in your terminal to build `sim`:

----
~/ark/1st$ make
gcc -Werror -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c11 -o sim sim.c
~/ark/1st$ make
make: 'sim' is up to date.
----

`make` saves us some work by not compiling things again, if everything is up to
date. Try modifying `sim.c` (e.g. add some comments) and see what happens when
you run `make` again.

The reason you can get away with just typing `make` is that `sim` is the
__default target__ in our Makefile. The default target is the uppermost target
in the Makefile, and is usually called `all`.  Add an `all` target, listing
`sim` as a prerequisite, just below your variables:

.~/ark/1st/Makefile
----
all: sim
----

Add another canonical target to the bottom of your Makefile, called `clean`.

.~/ark/1st/Makefile
----
clean:
	rm -f sim
----

[TIP]
====
The `-f` argument "forces" `rm` to remove the file. In practice this means that
warnings are suppressed if the file doesn't exist, and read-only files are
deleted as well. `-f` should otherwise be used with caution.
====

We stated previously that a target is first-and-foremost a file, but  `all` and
`clean` are not files! Their recipes produce no such files. Such targets are
called __phony targets__. Phony targets are always out of date. (Because
otherwise, if the files `all` or `clean` did exist, they would always be up to
date!)

At the very top of your Makefile, declare `all` and `clean` to be phony targets
like so:

.~/ark/1st/Makefile
----
.PHONY: all clean
----

Your Makefile should now look like this (remember the tabs):

.~/ark/1st/Makefile
----
.PHONY: all clean

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Werror -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c11

all: sim

sim: mips32.h sim.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o sim sim.c

clean:
	rm -f sim
----

The handout included two directories `c` and `asm`. Each contains a Makefile
we've written which will compile all the c and assembly code in the directories
`c` and `asm`, respectively.

We can call `make` recursively on those directories using the `-C` command-line
argument. For instance, try this out in your terminal:

----
~/ark/1st$ make -C asm
make: Entering directory '/home/archimedes/ark/1st/asm'
...
make: Leaving directory '/home/archimedes/ark/1st/asm'
----

Or this:

----
~/ark/1st$ make -C asm clean
make: Entering directory '/home/archimedes/ark/1st/asm'
rm -f *.o
rm -f *.elf
make: Leaving directory '/home/archimedes/ark/1st/asm'
----

It would be useful as we are developing the simulator to add new assembly and
C files for testing, and quickly compile them as we go. Let's make this a part
of our Makefile:

====

**OPTIONAL EXERCISE**

As part of your `all` target, make sure to recursively make the directories `c`
and `asm`. As part of your `clean` target, make sure to recursively clean the
directories `c` and `asm`.

====

[TIP]
.Entering, leaving directory
====
You can silence recursive invocations of `make` a little bit by adding the
command-line argument `--no-print-directory`.
====

=== The Interface

The simulator will be a program which takes two command-line arguments:

. the path to a text file specifying the initial values of the temporary
registers (this is useful for testing); and

. the path to an ELF executable.

The 8 initial temporary values are given in a simple text file,
separated by whitespace. For instance, if we want `t5` to be initialized to the
value `42`, we can provide a configuration file like this:

----
~/ark/1st$ cat default.cfg 
0
0
0
0
0
42
0
0
----

So if we have, `default.cfg` and an ELF executable `~/ark/1st/asm/nor.elf`, we
want to execute the simulator (which we'll call `sim`) like this:

----
~/ark/1st$ ./sim default.cfg asm/nor.elf
----

The `argc` and `argv` arguments in your `main` function can be used to fetch
command-line arguments. We must first check that the right number have been
given, before calling any other functions which use these arguments.

====

***EXERCISE***

Write an `if` statement in your `main` function, that checks that the number of
arguments is 3.  The first argument will always be the name of the executable
(e.g. `"./sim"`). The rest, as passed on the command line.  For instance, for
the example above, the three arguments will be `"./sim"`, `"default.cfg"`, and
`"asm/nor.elf"` (in that order).

If there are, as expected, three arguments, then call a function called
`read_config`, which takes one parameter, namely the second argument
(`argv[1]`).  Otherwise, print a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_message[usage message] informing the user
how the program is intended to be used, and return `ERROR_INVALID_ARGS`. Use
the `#define` to define `ERROR_INVALID_ARGS` at the top of your `sim.c`.
`read_config` should return an integer; return this value from `main`, whenever
you get this far.

In order to compile this, you will need to define a function stub for
`read_config`, which does nothing, prior to the declaration of `main`:

.~/ark/1st/sim.c
----
int read_config (const char *path) {
  path = path;
  printf("Readfile!\n");
  return 0;
}
----

The assignment of `path` to itself is necessary to suppress compiler warnings
about unused arguments.

In C, a string is an array of characters in memory. A string is thus a pointer
(denoted with an asterisk in the above) to the first character in the string.
Strings are terminated with a nul (`\0`) byte.

Recompile and run your code. You should do this often to catch bugs before they
multiply!

====

=== Setting up the Registers

In MIPS32, there are 32 general-purpose registers. In assembly, a register is
referenced using either its name or number. In machine code, 5 bits (2^5 = 32)
are sufficient to identify a register. We can use a static array `regs` to
model the register file, where the array index corresponds to the register
number.  These registers will initially be set to 0. 

====

***MODELLING CONCEPT***

Variables are "statically allocated" when declared outside of a function
declaration. The conventional place to put a static variable declaration is at
the top of a C file. **Think:** Why shouldn't we put static variables in header
files?

The distinctive thing about static variables is that they have a static size,
predetermined at compile-time. They are 0-initialized at program start-up
(before running `main`), and are available to all functions in the C file
throughout the lifetime of the program.

Static variables are convenient for modelling elements of a predetermined size,
which should persist throughout the lifetime of a program.  For instance, the
registers in a MIPS32 simulator.

====

In MIPS32, all registers are 32 bits in size. Many standard C types, including
`int`, are not guaranteed to be of some exact size on all CPU architectures.
Yet, it is most appropriate to model a register with a type we know is always
exactly 32 bits in size. Exact integer types are available in the standard C
library, under the `stdint.h` header.

====

***MODELLING CONCEPT***

`uint32_t` is a data type defined in `stdint.h`, representing a 32-bit unsigned
(nonnegative) integer. `uint32_t` is useful for modeling 32-bit registers.

====

====

***EXERCISE***

Include `stdint.h` at the top of your `sim.c`. Define a static `uint32_t`
called `PC`, and define a static array `regs` for the general-purpose
registers. You might find it useful to `#define` macros like `AT`, `V0`, `V1`,
`SP`, `RA`, etc. standing in for the respective elements of the `regs` array.

====

It is time to fill in the `read_config` stub and initialize the temporary
registers as specified in the given configuration file (`default.cfg`). This is
done in 3 steps:

. open the file for reading;
. read the file; and
. close the file.

==== Opening and Closing Files

An open file is identified by a non-negative integer, known as a __file
descriptor__, which is provided by the operating system when the file is
opened. The function `fopen` (also in `stdio.h`) can be used to open a file.
The __manual page__ for `fopen` can be
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fopen.3.html[found online], or read in the
terminal by typing:

----
$ man fopen
----

We can see the function prototype:

----
FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char *mode);
----

Replace the first two lines of the body of your `read_config` function with the
single line:

----
FILE *fdesc = fopen(path, "r");
----

which gives a file descriptor for the file, opened in read-only mode. 

====

**EXERCISE**

We need to check that this call is successful, so it should be wrapped in an
`if` statement checking if the return value from `fopen` is `NULL`. You should
always check function return values to see if a call was successful; the
man-page section `RETURN VALUE` will specify which values indicate success and
failure respectively. If the return value from `fopen` was `NULL`, return the
constant `ERROR_IO_ERROR` from `read_config` (use `#define` to define the
constant).

====

====

**EXERCISE**

Define a function stub `read_config_stream`, which takes a single variable of
type `FILE *` as parameter and returns an integer. Call this function once the
file has been opened with `fdesc` as argument. Use
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fclose.3.html[the man page] for `fclose`
to find out how to close the file again in `read_config`, after the call to
`read_config_stream`. Return `ERROR_IO_ERROR` if `fclose` returns anything
other than 0. If `fclose` does return 0, return the return value of
`read_config_stream` from `read_config`.

====

==== Reading Integers Off of a Stream

====

**EXERCISE**


Write a loop in `read_config_stream` which loops 8 times, calling
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/scanf.3.html[`fscanf`] in every iteration
to read an unsigned integer into the appropriate slot of the `regs` array. You
should only initialize the registers `t0` to `t7`.

The `fscanf` function takes three (or more) arguments: A file descriptor
(`FILE *`), a format string, and one or more pointer arguments (whose type(s)
must correspond appropriately to the pattern in the format string). For
instance, the code

----
uint32_t v;
fscanf(fdesc, "%u", &v);
----

scans from the current position in the file descriptor `fdesc`, finds the first
group of bytes that looks like a textual representation of an unsigned integer
(`%u`), constructs an actual `uint32_t` value based on these bytes, and puts
that value into the variable `v`. It is useful to think of a file descriptor as
a __stream__ of bytes: With each call to `fscanf`, you are searching further
down the stream for bytes that look like the string representation of an
unsigned integer.

Remember to check for error conditions from `fscanf`.  If an error occurs,
return an appropriate error value from `read_config_stream`.

For more, see http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/scanf.3.html[the man page]
for `fscanf`.

====


==== Showing Status

It is worthwhile to check whether the initialization procedure actually works.
Do this by getting a bit ahead and write a general status function for the
simulator. The simulator status consists of the number of instructions the
simulator has executed so far, and a printing of the PC and some of the
prominent registers.

====

**EXERCISE**

Declare a static `size_t instr_cnt` which will be used to keep track of how
many instructions the simulator has executed. `size_t` is the largest one-word
integer data type on your machine. `size_t` is already defined in `stdio.h`.

Write a function `show_status` which takes no arguments, and call it from
`main` after the registers are successfully initialized. Use the
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html[`printf`] function to print
the simulator status to the standard output. Use the formant `%zu` for `size_t`
types, and `%x` for printing integers in hex. See
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html[the man page] for `printf`
for details on how to format output.

The printing should follow the format as given below in "printf syntax":

----
Executed %zu instruction(s).
pc = 0x%x
at = 0x%x
v0 = 0x%x
v1 = 0x%x
t0 = 0x%x
t1 = 0x%x
t2 = 0x%x
t3 = 0x%x
t4 = 0x%x
t5 = 0x%x
t6 = 0x%x
t7 = 0x%x
sp = 0x%x
ra = 0x%x
----

OBS! Please follow this format precisely as your code will be subject to
automated testing.

For the `default.cfg` given above, this should result in the following output:

----
Ran 0 instrucitons(s).
pc = 0x0
at = 0x0
v0 = 0x0
v1 = 0x0
t0 = 0x0
t1 = 0x0
t2 = 0x0
t3 = 0x0
t4 = 0x0
t5 = 0x2a
t6 = 0x0
t7 = 0x0
sp = 0x0
ra = 0x0
----

=== Setting up the Memory

====

**MODELLING CONCEPT**

Memory, similarly to registers, can be modelled with a static array. Unlike
registers, memory is byte addressed; it is more natural to model memory by a
static array of a byte-sized data type. C does not have a dedicated "byte"
type, but C programmers canonically use the byte-sized `unsigned char`.

====

====

**EXERCISE**

Declare a static `unsigned char` array `mem` at the top of `sim.c` of size
640KB. For now, this will be our memory component. Declare a macro `MEMSZ`
which holds the static size of `mem`.

====

We would like our simulator to run MIPS32 ELF executables. That way, we can
easily run both simple programs written in assembly, as well as more
complicated programs written in e.g. C. Dealing with the
http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf[ELF file format] directly is a
somewhat laborious task. Although there are some useful build utilities like
`mips-elf-objcopy`, we find it more flexible to offer you a simple ELF parser
written in C. You will find the ELF parser in the handed out `elf.h` and
`elf.c`.

To use the parser, you need to do three things:

====
**EXERCISE**

. Include the header file `elf.h` at the top of your `sim.c`.

. Add an `elf.o` target to your Makefile. List `elf.h` and `elf.c` as its
prerequisites. Use the `-c` flag to `gcc` to compile `elf.c` into an object
file.

. Modify the `sim` target in your Makefile. List `elf.o` as a prerequisite.
It is now necessary to pass `elf.o` on to `gcc` to successfully compile
`sim.c`:

.~/ark/1st/Makefile
----
sim: mips32.h elf.o sim.c
  $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o sim elf.o sim.c
----

. Modify the `clean` target in your Makefile to also delete all `*.o` files.

.~/ark/1st/Makefile
----
clean:
	rm -f sim
	rm -f *.o
----

====

The ELF parser offers exactly one function:

.~/ark/1st/elf.h
----
int elf_dump(const char *path, uint32_t *entry,
  unsigned char *mem, size_t memsz);
----

Like `fscanf`, `elf_dump` is an example of a function which takes both
"regular" arguments (`path` and `memsz`), and result arguments, i.e. the
addresses of variables in which to store the result of the function call
(`entry` and `mem`). In particular, it takes a path to an ELF executable, reads
the file, stores the entry point at the given `entry` address, and copies all
program segments (including sections like `.text` and `.data`) into the memory
starting at `mem`, writing at most `memsz` bytes past `mem`.

[NOTE]
====
`size_t` is defined as an integer data type large enough to store any memory
size or offset on your machine. `size_t` is already defined in `stdio.h`.
====


The effect of `elf_dump` on the memory starting at `mem` is the exact same as
doing

----
~/ark/1st/asm$ mips-elf-objcopy -O binary addu.elf addu.bin
----

And then reading the contents of `~/ark/1st/asm/addu.bin` directly into the
memory starting at `mem`.

====

**EXERCISE**

Call the `elf_dump` function from your `main` function, after the registers are
successfully initialized. Here is how you might call `elf_dump` from `main`:

.~/ark/1st/sim.c
----
elf_dump(argv[2], &PC, &mem[0], MEMSZ);
----

Make sure to check the return value of `elf_dump`. The entry point and memory
is invalid so long as `elf_dump` returns a non-zero value.

====

====

**C quirk**

In our sample call to `elf_dump` we used `&mem[0]`. You might wonder why we
couldn't just use `mem`?

It is a common misconception that C array names are mere pointers.  The names
of statically- or stack-allocated arrays are pointers to arrays of a particular
size. So `mem` is a pointer to an array of size `MEMSZ`, whatever that is. A
pointer with size information is different from a bare pointer. However, it is
easy to construct a bare pointer from a value in C, by taking the address of
(`&`) that value.

====

====

**Integral types**

The range of integral types in use, and their headers, is perhaps starting to
get a bit overwhelming, so let's recap:

|===
| *Type* | *Sort of values* | *Our use* | `#include`
| `int`  | Positive and negative two's complement integers. | Function (and program!) return values. | (Nothing)
| `uint8_t` | Unsigned (nonnegative) 8-bit integers. | (None) | `stdint.h`
| `uint16_t` | Unsigned (nonnegative) 16-bit integers. | (None) | `stdint.h`
| `uint32_t` | Unsigned (nonnegative) 32-bit integers. | Modelling 32-bit registers. | `stdint.h`
| `unsigned char` | Smallest addressable unit of the machine that can contain a basic character set (typically an unsigned 8-bit integer).  | Modelling bytes in memory. | (Nothing)
| `size_t`  | Memory sizes and offsets. | `instr_cnt` and fourth argument to `elf_dump`. | `stddef.h`
|===

====


=== Interpreting Instructions

==== Memory Layout and Endianness

At this point you might be wondering how come the entry point is so high. For
instance, the entry point always seems to be something like `0x400018`
(somewhere beyond 4MB), while we only allocate 640 KB of memory.

This has to do with the conventional memory layout of a MIPS32 process, and how
`elf_dump` supports this memory layout. You can read more about the MIPS32
memory layout in Appendix A.5 of <<COD>>. The crucial detail is that the
lower 4MB are reserved for the operating system. Your linker assumes that this
is always the case and _offsets_ all machine code addresses (including the
entry point) by `0x400000` (4MB).

`elf_dump` supports this memory layout in the sense that it fills `mem`
starting at the first byte past address `0x400000`. We can illustrate this as
follows:

----
=========================================================
=      MIPS32 Memory Layout   =     mem Memory Layout   =
=========================================================
=           +--------------+  =     +--------------+    =
=           |   Stack top  |  =     |   Stack top  |    =
=                 ...         =           ...           =
=           | Data segment |  =     | Data Segment |    =
= 0x400000  | Text segment |  = 0x0 | Text Segment |    =
= 0x0       | Reserved     |  =     +--------------+    =
=           +--------------+  =                         =
=========================================================
----

Luckily for you, the header file `mips32.h` already defines the macros
`GET_BIGWORD` and `SET_BIGWORD` which take care of offsetting the address
before dealing with the memory component. For instance, we can use
`GET_BIGWORD(mem, PC)` to get the `mem` instruction currently pointed to by
`PC`.

====

**EXERCISE**

After successfully initializing registers and memory in `main`, set the `SP`
(stack pointer register) to point to the top of the stack. This is the 4th last
byte in `mem`. As any memory address, the stack pointer should also be offset
by `MIPS_RESERVE` (`0x400000`, defined in `mips32.h`).

====

`GET_BIGWORD` and `SET_BIGWORD` do more than merely offset the addresses. You
might have also noticed that MIPS32 is a so-called "big-endian" architecture,
while your own machine is likely an x86-64 architecture, which is
"little-endian".

The best choice of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness[endianness] is
subtle, often accidental, and there is no clear benefit of one over the other.
In a big-endian architecture, the bytes of a word (or half-word) are stored in
order of decreasing significance (most-significant byte first). In a
little-endian architecture, the bytes of a word (or half-word) are stored in
order of increasing significance (least-significant byte first). The choice of
endianness has no effect on the order of the words (or half-words) themselves.

We can illustrate this difference with our go-to example-instruction, `addu $2,
$4, $5`:

.`addu $2, $4, $5` in big-endian format
----
00000000 10000101 00010000 00100001
----

.`addu $2, $4, $5` in little-endian format
----
00100001 00010000 10000101 00000000
----

With the ELF file format, the memory segments are stored in the format expected
by the target architecture. So for MIPS32, big-endian.  `elf_dump` performs no
endianness conversion before storing data in `mem`, and so all data in `mem` is
in big-endian format. Luckily, you don't have to think too much about this as
long as you use the macros `GET_BIGWORD` and `SET_BIGWORD` whenever you're
dealing with memory.

====

**MODELLING CONCEPT**

We used an array of `uint32_t` values to model registers, and an array of
`unsigned char` values to model memory. If you are running a little-endian
architecture, this means that we model e.g. registers with little-endians, and
memory with big-endians. This inconsistency is unsettling, but dealing in
native data types, such as `uint32_t`, is a lot more simple than juggling
bytes.

====

==== The Interpretation Loop

`mips32.h` also defines many other useful macros for dealing with MIPS32
instructions.

====

**EXERCISE**

Define a function stub `interp`, which takes no arguments and
returns an integer.

Modify your `main` function to do 5 things:

. initialize the registers;
. read the ELF file;
. initialize `SP`;
. call `interp`; and
. show resulting simulator status.

At least 3 of these steps may fail. Check the return values appropriately
before going from step to step.

====

====

**EXERCISE**

`interp` should run an infinite loop, counting up the `instr_cnt` variable in
every iteration. To perform an iteration, you should get the instruction
currently pointed to by `PC`, increment the `PC`.

To actually interpret the instructions (perhaps having an effect on either the
contents of the `regs` or `mem`), define a function stub `interp_inst`, which
takes the instruction as a `uint32_t` argument.

The return value of `interp_inst` should determine whether to continue or break
out of the loop:

* You should break out of the loop, and finish simulation gracefully if
`interp_inst` sees the special `syscall` instruction.

* You should break out of the loop and report an error if some error occurred
in `interp_inst` (e.g. unsupported instruction).

* You should continue the infinite loop if `interp_inst` did not see a
`syscall` instruction, and no error occurred during `interp_inst`.

====

====

**MISSING ON THE "GREEN CARD"**

You won't find the `syscall` instruction on the "green card" in <<COD>>. It
is an R-type instruction with funct `0xc`. There is already a `FUNCT_SYSCALL`
in `mips32.h`. See below for details on how to handle R-type instructions.

====

////
*Exercise:* In `interp`, use (left) bitshifts (`<<`) and the logical OR
(`|`) operations to reconstruct the instruction as a 32 bit unsigned integer
from the four bytes at the positions noted above. You will want to save the
result as an unsigned 32 bit integer, type `uint32_t`, which is defined in a
library `stdint.h`. A preprocessor macro has been provided for the
lazy/impatient. 

====

**EXERCISE**

Write a function stub `interp_instr`, which takes as argument the
`uint32_t` instruction, and which is called by `interp`. Use a `while` loop
to iterate over the instructions, calling `interp_instr` with a reconstructed
instruction before incrementing the `pc` by 4 up to `instr_mem_size`. As the
`pc` is a global variable, the incremented value will be read by
`interp_instr`. `interp` should return the value returned by `interp_instr` if
it is non-zero, otherwise it should return 0 once all instructions have been
processed.
====
////

The opcode of an instruction is the highest 6 bits of the instruction. The
opcode can be obtained as follows:

----
unsigned int opcode = inst >> 26;
----

where `inst` is the `uint32_t` instruction. Note that this shifting may only
work on unsigned integers; if the number was a signed negative number, the
first digit of the number would be 1, which would be replicated to fill the
holes caused by the shifting, in order to maintain the sign. This is known as
sign extension. However, as we are working with unsigned integers here, the
holes are filled with 0s.

====

**EXERCISE**

In `interp_instr`, use a `switch ... case` construct on the extracted opcode.
Symbols have been defined corresponding to the different instructions by
`#define` preprocessor directives in the provided `mips32.h` header file. If
the instruction being handled is an R-type instruction, then call a function
`interp_r`, which takes the reconstructed instruction as an argument. All the
other defined opcodes should result in a call to a specific function for that
instruction.  Remember to break after each case!

The default case should return `ERROR_UNKNOWN_OPCODE`.

Come up with your own special return value in case you see a `syscall`
instruction.

====

==== R-Type Instructions

R-type instructions all have the same opcode, 0. The actual operation to be
carried out is specified by the `funct` field. As we have seen earlier, an
R-type instruction has the following format:

----
31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
[     opcode    ] [     rs     ] [     rt     ] [     rd     ] [ funct  ] [  shamt  ]
----

Luckily for you, the macros `GET_RS`, `GET_RT`, `GET_RD`, `GET_FUNCT` and
`GET_SHAMT` have already been defined in `mips32.h`, which extract the
corresponding fields from the 32-bit instruction using bitwise operations.

Both signed and unsigned versions of some of the instructions are implemented
by the MIPS32 architecture. The difference between these is that the signed
versions can cause an overflow exception. This causes the CPU to jump to a
special memory address, known as an exception handler, before execution
continues. You will learn more about exceptions later in the course/in the
Operating Systems course. We will not handle this right now, and just assume
that everything goes swimmingly.

====

**EXERCISE**

In `interp_r`, depending upon the value of the funct field of the instruction
(use the predefined `FUNCT_*` constants), update the *contents* of the register
corresponding to `rd` with the result of the operation on the source registers
`rs` and `rt` (and `shamt` for the logical shift operations.) The semantics of
these operations are described in Verilog on the "green card" in <<COD>>.
Remember to `break` after each case. The `default` case should return
`ERROR_UNKNOWN_FUNCT`.

These operations would be carried out by the ALU on a physical architecture.

Implement support for all the funct constants defined  in `mips32.h`.

====

==== J-Type Instructions

The J-type instructions have the format:

----
31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
[     opcode    ] [                             address                             ]
----

The address field of a J-type instruction is only 26 bits long, and we wish to
index addresses that are 32 bits long. As instructions are word aligned, we can
left-shift the address field by 2, to provide a word aligned address. The upper
4 bits are taken from the upper 4 bits of the incremented Program Counter
(`pc`), yielding a "pseudodirect" address (see <<COD>> page 117, figure 2.18).
The jumps are implemented by simply replacing the lower 28 bits of the `pc`
variable with the left-shifted address field from the instruction. The `pc`
should have been incremented to point to the next instruction at this stage.

====

**EXERCISE**

Implement the `j` and `jal` instructions in their own functions, called from
`interp`. The macro `GET_ADDRESS` has been defined for you in `mips32.h`.

====

==== I-Type Instructions.

The immediate instructions have the format:

----
31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
[     opcode    ] [     rs     ] [     rt     ] [             immediate             ]
----

The immediate instructions operate on two registers, with a 16 bit constant.
The 16 bit constant must be extended to 32 bits. Depending on the instruction,
this number can be either signed or unsigned, and either a sign-extension or a
zero-extension must be carried out in each case. After using the macro
`GET_IMM`, the result must be cast to either a signed or unsigned 16 bit wide
integer (`int16_t` and `uint16_t` from the library `stdint.h` respectively).
Then, casting this to a signed 32 bit integer (`int32_t`) will ensure that it
is sign or zero extended respectively. A macro `SIGN_EXTEND` has been provided.
This sign-extended immediate must then be shifted left by 2 bits to yield the
PC-relative address.

====

**EXERCISE**

. Implement the `beq` and `bne` instructions. Note that the addresses for the
branching instructions are contained in the immediate field, and are
word-aligned, PC-relative addresses.

. Implement the `lw` and `sw` instructions. Remember to use the `GET_BIGWORD`
and `SET_BIGWORD` macros for accessing the memory in `mem`.

. Implement the `addiu`, `andi`, `ori`, and `slti` instructions. 

====

==== Pseudo-instructions

You already support the `move` and `nop` pseudo-instructions by supporting the
instructions `or` and `sll`, respectively. *Mental exercise:* How come?

==== Branch Delay Slot

For technical reasons (which will first become relevant in G2), the instruction
immediately following a branch or jump instruction (e.g. `beq`, `bne`, `j`,
`jal` and `jr`) is always executed. To accommodate this, the assembler will
reorder your assembly, and if necessary, add a `nop` after the branch
instruction.

You can turn this off by adding the assembler directive `.set noreorder` at the
top of your assembly files. Alternatively, you can implement a branch delay
slot. For the single-cycle architecture, this will almost be a "hack" or
"spoof". In G2, this will be a lot more elegant.

== Submitting Your Solution

Follow these steps to submit your solution.

=== Finalize Your Solution

Clean up your code, remove superfluous code, and add comments for the
non-trivial parts.

Write a *short* report (`g1-report.txt` or `g1-report.pdf`) documenting your

decisions you have had to make, if any. To back your claims, we humbly
encourage you to fill `~/ark/1st/asm` with a plethora of tests. Discuss your
tests (and how to run them) in your report.

Your report should be sufficient to get a good idea of the extent and quality
of your implementation. **Your code will only be used to verify the claims you
make in your report**.

----
~/ark$ tar cvf g1-code.tar.gz 1st
----

=== Submit on Absalon

Submit *two files* on Absalon:

. Your report (`g1-report.txt` or `g1-report.pdf`)
. Your archive (`g1-code.tar.gz`)

Remember to *mark your team members* on Absalon.

////

*Exercise:* Write a test for your simulator. In a text file, argue for why your
test is sufficient. You may wish to use the the preprocessor directives
`#ifdef` and `#endif` to e.g. `printf` the operation and operands if the symbol
`DEBUG` is `#define` d.

////

== Optional: Interpreting C

We are not far from the bare essentials necessary to run simple C code on our
simulator. Getting this to work is a completely optional, supplementary
exercise.

Create a directory `~/ark/1st/c/`, similar to `~/ark/1st/asm/`, and consider a
very simple C program:

.~/ark/1st/c/universe.c
----
int main() {
  return 42;
}
----

We already know how to compile programs using GCC, and you might've already
guessed that we've already installed something called `mips-elf-gcc`. A naïve
way to compile `universe.c` would be:

----
~/ark/1st/c$ mips-elf-gcc -mips32 -o universe.elf universe.c
mips-elf/bin/ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to
0000000000400018
~/ark/1st/c$ file universe.elf
universe.elf: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV),
statically linked, not stripped
----

We can see why this is naïve if we try to _disassemble_ `universe.elf`:

----
~/ark/1st/c$ mips-elf-objdump -d universe.elf
...
00400018 <_init>:
...
004001a4 <frame_dummy>:
...
0040020c <main>:
...
00400230 <__do_global_ctors_aux>:
...
00400290 <_fini>:
----

It looks like GCC has generated a great deal of "bloat" around a rather simple
C program. This is because GCC will by default package a couple of things for
your convenience, should you choose to link your program against e.g. the
standard C library.

We certainly don't need any such convenience here! `-nostdlib` to the rescue:

----
~/ark/1st/c$ mips-elf-gcc -mips32 -nostdlib -o universe.elf universe.c
mips-elf/bin/ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to
0000000000400018
~/ark/1st/c$ mips-elf-objdump -d universe.elf 

universe.elf:     file format elf32-bigmips


Disassembly of section .text:

00400018 <main>:
  400018: 27bdfff8  addiu sp,sp,-8
  40001c: afbe0004  sw  s8,4(sp)
  400020: 03a0f021  move  s8,sp
  400024: 2402002a  li  v0,42
  400028: 03c0e821  move  sp,s8
  40002c: 8fbe0004  lw  s8,4(sp)
  400030: 27bd0008  addiu sp,sp,8
  400034: 03e00008  jr  ra
  400038: 00000000  nop

From the look of the output above, all we need to support in our simulator are
the `addiu`, `sw`, `lw`, `jr`, `nop`, and `addu` instructions. (`move` and `li`
are pseudo-instructions, which in binary form correspond to `addu` and `addiu`,
respectively.)

Let us briefly recap what this program does. First, it allocates 8 bytes of
stack space, and uses 4 of those bytes to store the callee-saves frame pointer
(`s8` is a synonym for `fp`). It then sets the stack pointer as the new frame
pointer. This frame is never used, but it is set up. The program then stores
the value `42` in register `v0`, clears the frame and returns to `ra`.

Crucially, `main` assumes that someone has already jump-and-linked to it. This
is typically done by the operating system. As we have no operating system
embedded in our simulator, we will wrap our C programs with some assembly. This
assembly will define a `_start` label, jump-and-link to `main`, linking it back
to a terminating `syscall` instruction:

.~/ark/1st/c/_start.S
----
.globl _start
.text
_start:
  jal main
  syscall
----

To wrap a C program, we merely need to list `_start.S` together with the main
C file when compiling:

----
~/ark/1st/c$ mips-elf-gcc -mips32 -nostdlib -o universe.elf _start.S universe.c
~/ark/1st/c$ mips-elf-objdump -d universe.elf 

universe.elf:     file format elf32-bigmips


Disassembly of section .text:

00400018 <_ftext>:
  400018: 0c100009  jal 400024 <main>
  40001c: 00000000  nop
  400020: 0000000c  syscall

00400024 <main>:
  400024: 27bdfff8  addiu sp,sp,-8
  400028: afbe0004  sw  s8,4(sp)
  40002c: 03a0f021  move  s8,sp
  400030: 2402002a  li  v0,42
  400034: 03c0e821  move  sp,s8
  400038: 8fbe0004  lw  s8,4(sp)
  40003c: 27bd0008  addiu sp,sp,8
  400040: 03e00008  jr  ra
  400044: 00000000  nop
----

It will be convenient to package these observations into the `Makefile` for the
`~/ark/1st/c/` directory, just as we did for `~/ark/1st/asm/`.

The `universe.elf` is no special ELF file, so it should be straightforward to
run `universe.elf` on our simulator:

----
~/ark/1st$ ./sim default.cfg c/universe.elf 
Ran 9 instruction(s).
pc = 0x400024
at = 0x4a00ff
v0 = 0x2a
v1 = 0x0
t0 = 0x0
t1 = 0x0
t2 = 0x0
t3 = 0x0
t4 = 0x2a
t5 = 0x0
t6 = 0x0
t7 = 0x0
sp = 0x4a00ff
ra = 0x400020
----

Of course, we still have a long way to go before we can simulate our simulator
on our simulator.

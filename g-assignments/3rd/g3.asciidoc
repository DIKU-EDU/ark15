This is the last in a series of three G-assignments ("G" for "Godkendelse"
and/or "Gruppeopgave") which you must pass in order to be eligible for the
exam in the course http://www.webcitation.org/6a2I3GpLv[Machine
Architecture (ARK)] at http://www.diku.dk[DIKU]. We encourage
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming[pair programming], so please
form groups of 2-3 students.

public GitHub repository at https://github.com/onlineta/ark15.

== Assignment

It's been a long and trecherous path towards G3. To make your time more
manageable, we decided to make the vast majority of this assignment
*optional, but highly recommended*.

*The mandatory part of your assignment is to finish off the optional parts
of G2, and fix the problems in your solutions for
https://github.com/onlineta/ark15/blob/master/g-assignments/1st/g1.asciidoc[G1]
and
https://github.com/onlineta/ark15/blob/master/g-assignments/2nd/g2.asciidoc[G2].
The rest of this assignment, G3, as such, is for your further study, only.*

You should submit a pipelined simulator, which adequately handles MEM, EX,
and lw/use hazards. The simulator should support the following
instructions: `addu`, `addiu`, `and`, `andi`, `beq`, `bne`, `j`, `jal`,
`jr`, `lw`, `lui`, `nor`, `or`, `ori`, `sll`, `slt`, `sltu`, `slti`,
`sltiu`, `srl`, `subu`, `sw`, and of course, halt on a `syscall`
instruction.

You can also submit a pipelined simulator (as above) which also models a
2-level cache hierarchy, with a separate instruction- and data-cache, as
well as a shared L2-cache. This is a good exercise, and feedback will be
given on your implementation.

[IMPORTANT]
.Prioritize your time
====
To make an informed choice, take a look at
http://www.webcitation.org/6a2I3GpLv[the course description], and some of
the
https://absalon.itslearning.com/Folder/processfolder.aspx?FolderID=3112456[old
exams]. Try to get an overview of what you need to know, and focus your
studies on where you feel least confident. Beware however, that confidence
is no substitute for knowledge.
====

If the effect of caching on performance is where you feel least confident,
then this assignment is for you. In addition, this assignment further
exercises modularization, stack-allocation (vs. static allocation), loops,
bit-fiddling, and passing pointers around in C. This is a very good
exercise before you proceed with the courses on
http://www.webcitation.org/6c4dciEhE[Compilers] and
http://www.webcitation.org/6c4diyg95[Operating Systems and Concurrent
Programming]. If nothing else, we strongly recommend that you take a look
at it in your own free time.

Extend the configuration file format to also list the configuration for
three caches — a separate instruction and data cache, as well as a shared
L2 cache. The configuration for each cache is 3-fold "cache configuration
line", listing the number of sets in the cache, the number of blocks per
set, and the number of words per block. The numbers are all powers of 2,
separated by commas, each of value at least 1, and at most 65536.

Here is the new configuration file format in scanf-style syntax:

----
%u
%u
%u
%u
%u
%u
%u
%u
%zu,%zu,%zu
%zu,%zu,%zu
%zu,%zu,%zu
----

Here is a sample configuration file that adheres to this format:

----
3
2
0
0
0
0
0
0
4,2,1
2,1,4
1,4,2
----

Extend your `show_status` function to _also_ print the number of cache hits
and misses while simulating the given program. Skew the number of clock
cycles to model realistic performance. Assume that *a level-one cache miss
costs 20 clock cycles*, and *a level-two cache miss costs 400 clock
cycles*.  Note, it is not a requirement that you actually stall the
pipeline.

Your `show_status` should adhere to the following printf-style format:

----
Executed %zu instruction(s).
%zu cycle(s) elapsed.
icache hits: %zu, misses: %zu.
dcache hits: %zu, misses: %zu.
l2cache hits: %zu, misses: %zu.
pc = 0x%x
at = 0x%x
v0 = 0x%x
v1 = 0x%x
t0 = 0x%x
t1 = 0x%x
t2 = 0x%x
t3 = 0x%x
t4 = 0x%x
t5 = 0x%x
t6 = 0x%x
t7 = 0x%x
sp = 0x%x
ra = 0x%x
----

Implement a write-back writing strategy, with a random replacement
strategy.

Happy hacking!

== Introduction

A recurring theme in academia and industry is to question how to squeeze
the last ounce of performance out of your digital computer. As the
http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780123838728/[quantitative approach to
computer architecture] has shown, and as best exemplified by the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3paiCK3dlK0[the success of the MIPS
architecture], the best choice of computer architecture, depends on what
you use computers for.

Furthermore, it is often much cheaper, easier, and faster, to simulate
computer architectures than to build and measure the performance of
physical components.  The overarching theme for this year's G-assignments
has been to introduce you to the practice of writing dynamic software
simulators before making costly, static hardware choices.

In this assignment, we will consider how various cache sizes, cache
associativity, and cache block size, impact performance.

====

***MODELLING CONCEPT***

Variables in C are "stack allocated" when declared inside a function
definition. The conventional place to put a stack variable declaration is at
the top of a function declaration. This way it is easy to glance over how much
stack space the function will need.

Stack variables may have any size, known at the _time of declaration_.
Crucially, stack variables are *not* 0-initialized, and will contain
_garbage_. They are available to the remaining body of the function, but
using them after the function returns leads to _undefined behaviour_.
Garbage and undefined behaviour have a lot in common.

*Rule of thumb:* never return a pointer to a stack-allocated variable that was
allocated in the same function.

Stack variables are convenient for modelling elements whose size is determined
at runtime, and should persist throughout the lifetime of a function
call. For instance, the cache size, associativity, and block size, persist
throughout the duration of a call to the `interp` function.

====

== Getting Started

Recursively copy your solution to G2 into a new directory for this assignment.

----
~/ark$ mkdir 3rd
~/ark$ cp -r 2nd/* 3rd/
----

== A `mem` Module

We will abstract away all memory operations away into a separate memory
module which we'll call `mem`. This will make it easy to pass all memory
operations through a series of caches instead of accessing the memory
directly.

A _module_ in C is a pair files: a _header file_ and an _implementation
file_. The `mem` module consists of `mem.h` and `mem.c`, respectively.

The header file specifies the public interface (API) of the module: it is
included throughout the project. The implementation file provides the
actual implementation of the module: it is compiled separately, and it is
left to the linker to resolve external references to the module.

====

*EXERCISE*

1. Create a header file called `mem.h`.

2. Create an implementation file called `mem.c`, and `#include "mem.h"` in
`mem.c`.

====

====

*EXERCISE*

Begin `mem.h` with the following lines:

----
#ifndef ARK2015_MEM_H
#define ARK2015_MEM_H
----

And end it with the following line:

----
#endif // ARK2015_MEM_H
----

====

The `#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif` triple ensures that the macro
`ARK2015_MEM_H`, and everything else between the `#ifndef` and `#endif`, is
only ever defined once in the C program. If you recall, `#include` includes
the content of a file unconditionally, without any regard to whether this
file has been included before. "Include guards" like this, ensure that you
avoid problems like duplicate declarations, and enable you to (almost)
carelessly include `mem.h` where you see fit in your project.

=== Compiling the `mem` Module

To compile the `mem` module, you can do as we did with the `elf` module in
our `Makefile` in
https://github.com/onlineta/ark15/blob/master/g-assignments/1st/g1.asciidoc[G1].

====

*EXERCISE*

1. Add a target `mem.o` to your `Makefile`, with `mem.h` and `mem.c` as
prerequisites. Write a recipe for the `mem.o` target, in the same way as you
did with `elf.o`. (You might, however, want to compile `mem.c` with the `-g`
option to get GDB support.)

2. List `mem.o` as a prerequisite to `sim`, and add it to the recipe in the
same way as `elf.o`: The linker needs to know where to find the implementation
of the `mem` module. 

If in doubt about how Makefiles work, see
https://github.com/onlineta/ark15/blob/master/g-assignments/1st/g1.asciidoc[G1].

====

=== Using the `mem` Module

All memory operations should now happen through the `mem` module.

====

*EXERCISE*

1. Move the macro `MEMSZ` to `mem.h`.

2. Move the static byte-array `mem` from `sim.c` to `mem.c`.
   The `mem` array should be declared "static" in two senses:

  a. `mem` should be statically allocated, i.e. declared outside a function
declaration.

  b. `mem` should have internal linkage, i.e. it is not accessible outside
the `mem` module implementation file. To make a variable have internal
linkage, prefix its declaration with the keyword `static`.

====

The `mem` array should not (and by now, cannot) be accessed from `sim.c`
directly. Instead, define and use the functions `inst_read`, `data_read`,
and `data_write`.

====

*EXERCISE*

Declare the following functions in `mem.h`:

.~/ark/3rd/mem.h
----
int inst_read(uint32_t addr, uint32_t *read_inst);

int data_read(uint32_t addr, uint32_t *read_data);

int data_write(uint32_t addr, uint32_t data);
----

This is part of the public API of the `mem` module.

====

The `*_read` functions take two arguments: An address to read from and a
pointer to where to put the data read from memory. We distinguish between
`inst_read` and `data_read` as these should use separate caches.

*Mental exercise*: Why should we use separate instruction- and data
caches?

All three functions above return an `int`. A negative return value indicates an
error; a positive value indicates the number of clock cycles the processor
should stall in case of a cache miss.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This return value is not used in this guide. It is optional to actually
stall the pipeline on a cache miss, and to report anything other than 0
from `inst_read`, `data_read`, or `data_write`.
====

====

*EXERCISE*

1. Implement `inst_read`, `data_read`, and `data_write` in `mem.c`. For
now, let them just read directly from, or write directly to `mem` using the
good old `GET_BIGWORD` and `SET_BIGWORD` macros.

2. Remove all uses of `GET_BIGWORD` and `SET_BIGWORD` in `sim.c`. Use
`inst_read`, `data_read`, or `data_write` instead.

====

Before we can compile and test our code, we also need to fix the memory
initialization procedure. Since `sim.c` no longer has access to the `mem`
array, we will have to dump the ELF file in `mem.c` instead.

====

*EXERCISE*

Declare the following function in `mem.h`:

----
int mem_init(const char *path, uint32_t *PC);
----

This function should be called before any further operations with the `mem`
module.

====

The function should use `elf_dump` (declared in the `elf` module) to dump
the contents of the ELF file at the given path to the `mem` array in
`mem.c`. The function also takes the address of the PC register as
an argument, and passes this address on to `elf_dump`.

====

*EXERCISE*

* Implement `mem_init` in `mem.c`. The function should call `elf_dump` with
  the given arguments. You can use `&mem[0]` and `MEMSZ` (as before) for the
  remaining arguments. Let the return value of `mem_init` be the return value
  of `elf_dump`.

* Call `mem_init` where you otherwise would have called `elf_dump` in
  `sim.c`.

* Make sure to include everything you need in `mem.h` and `mem.c`. Clean up
  in the includes of `sim.c` and `mem.c`. Make sure that everything compiles.

====

====

*TESTING EXERCISE*

Your code should now compile and run as before. Make sure that it does.

====

[TIP]
.Troubleshooting
====
If you are hitting a segmentation fault on your use of `GET_BIGWORD` or
`SET_BIGWORD` in `mem.c`, it is likely because you are doing something with
`MIPS_RESERVE`. You shouldn't, yet. The implementations of `GET_BIGWORD`
and `SET_BIGWORD` will subtract `MIPS_RESERVE` from the address you pass to
them.
====

== Setting up the Caches

We would like to see how caches of various sizes, associativity and block
sizes affect program performance. In general, a cache consists of a number
of sets, each set consisting of a number of blocks, each block consisting
of a number of words. We can achieve the above dynamics by making it
possible to specify for every cache:

1. the number of sets in the cache,

2. the number of blocks per set, and

3. the number of words per block.

For instance, an eight-block direct-mapped cache has 1 set, and 8 blocks
per set. An eight-block fully-associative cache has 8 sets and 1 block per
set. If these layout schemes seem a little mysterious to you, see Figure
5.15 on p. 404 in <<COD5e>>.

In this assignment, we will only consider cache, set, and block sizes which
are powers of 2, of size at least 1, and at most 65536. For instance, the
maximum associativity you should support is 65536. *Mental exercise*: What
is the byte-size of the minimum and maximum cache that you should support?

=== Declaring the Caches

====

*EXERCISE*

Declare a struct `cache` in `mem.h` with the following fields:

1. `n_sets`,

2. `n_blocks_per_set`, and

3. `n_words_per_block`.

You can decide (and might later change) the numeric types of these fields.

You might also want to add more fields to this struct later.

Add also the following counter-variables to the struct:

1. `size_t hits`, and

2. `size_t misses`.

====

Next, we want to define the cache blocks themselves. Of course, a cache
consists of a number of sets, where each set consists of a number of
blocks. Although we could model this hierarchy, "sets" don't seem that
special: Assuming that all cache blocks are stored in one array, a set is
just a contiguous sub-array of this larger array of blocks.

Before defining this array, let us define the `block` struct itself:

====

*EXERCISE*

Declare a struct `block` above your declaration of the `cache` struct
in `mem.h`.

Add the following fields to the struct:

1. `bool valid`,

2. `bool modified`,

3. `uint32_t tag`, and

Finally, add the field `struct block *blocks` to your `cache` struct above
(below in `mem.h`).

====

The reason that `cache.blocks` is a pointer, rather than e.g. an array of a
given size, is that the size of this "array" is not known _at compile
time_. It is first known _at runtime_ — once the configuration file has
been read.

We also need a place to store the cache data itself. Although it might seem
natural to place the data in a block, we also don't know how many words a
block should store until runtime. We could include a pointer to the data
for every block in the `block` struct, but this would require an intricate
initialization procedure.

Instead, we could put all data into one, stack-allocated array, and offset
into this array once we know the set and block offset we are looking for.
It is a good idea to keep the data in the cache in big-endian format, as it
is stored in the memory. This models the hardware more closely. Therefore,
we will use an `unsigned char` (byte) array for the cache data itself.

====

*EXERCISE*

Add an `unsigned char *data` field to your `cache` struct.

====

We will need three instances of the `cache` struct in the `mem` module: one
for the instruction cache, one for the data cache, and one for the shared
L2 cache. The `mem` module should consult these caches before falling back
to accessing the `mem` array directly; thereby modelling a cache hierarchy.

====

*INTERNAL VS EXTERNAL LINKAGE*

Every function and every variable in C can be internally or externally
linked.  An internally linked variable or function is intended for use
inside the same module, only.

For instance, the `mem` array should have internal linkage as it shouldn't
be accessed directly from outside the `mem` module. To declare an
internally linked variable or function, don't mention it in the header
file, and prefix its implementation with the keyword `static`.

The functions `mem_init`, `data_read`, `inst_read`, and `data_write`, on
the other hand, should have external linkage: they are intended to be used
outside the `mem` module. To declare an externally linked variable or
function, declare it in the header file, and don't prefix its
implementation with the keyword `static`.

Although the three caches perhaps similarly shouldn't be accessed directly
from outside the `mem` module, we found it tedious to enforce their
internal linkage — `sim.c` needs to initialize and probe the caches for
status. Also, we thought it worth the exercise to show how you might
declare variables with external linkage.

====

====

*EXERCISE*

1. Declare three instances of type `struct cache` in `mem.h` called
`icache`, `dcache`, and `l2cache`. Prefix each declaration with the keyword
`extern`.

2. Declare three instances of type `struct cache` in `mem.h` called
exactly `icache`, `dcache`, and `l2cache`. 

====

These two steps will declare `icache`, `dcache` and `l2cache` as `cache`
structs accessible from both inside and outside the `mem` module.

====

*EXERCISE*

Define a function `read_cache_config` in `sim.c` with the following
interface:

----
int read_cache_config(FILE *fstream, struct cache *cache);
----

The function should read a cache configuration line as specified in
<<_assignment>>.

Call `read_cache_config` thrice in `read_config_stream` after you've read
off the values for the temporary registers.

====

=== Stack Allocation

Once you've read the cache configurations, you are ready to allocate arrays
of appropriate size. For any given cache, the number of blocks is its
`n_sets` times its `n_blocks_per_set`. It would be tedious to type this out
by hand, so let's define a macro for this in `mem.h`:

====

*EXERCISE*

Define a macro `N_BLOCKS` in `mem.h` which given a `cache` translates to
`cache.n_sets * cache.n_blocks_per_set`. (Remember to put the translation
in parentheses, to make sure that the macro behaves well in arithmetic
expressions.)

====

====

*EXERCISE*

At the top of your `interp` in `sim.c`, declare 3 stack-allocated arrays
for the blocks for the three different caches:

----
struct block icache_blocks[N_BLOCKS(icache)];
struct block dcache_blocks[N_BLOCKS(dcache)];
struct block l2cache_blocks[N_BLOCKS(l2cache)];
----

Then set the blocks field for each of the caches to point to these
stack-allocated arrays.

----
icache.blocks = icache_blocks;
dcache.blocks = dcache_blocks;
l2cache.blocks = l2cache_blocks;
----

====

The cache blocks are safe for use, as long as the `interp` function hasn't
returned. If you followed along our instructions, you shouldn't return from
the `interp` function before the simulator sees a `syscall` instruction, or
otherwise fails to execute an instruction, and no instructions are executed
after we return from `interp`.

Note, it is still safe to use all the other fields in the `cache` structs
after we return from `interp`.

Before proceeding with the rest of `interp`, it is important to note that
the cache blocks contain garbage: *stack-allocated variables are not
0-initialized*. One common strategy to 0-initialize e.g.  stack-allocated
arrays is to use the
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memset.3.html[`memset`] function,
defined in `string.h`, which has following interface:

----
void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);
----

`memset` takes a pointer to the first value of a memory area (e.g. a
stack-allocated array), the value to set every byte to (e.g. 0), and *the
number of bytes* to set. That is, the function will set the `n` bytes
starting at `s` to `c`. The function returns the given pointer, `s`. This
return value can be safely ignored.

*Mental exercise*: Why is the type `int` as the second argument to `memset`
a bad idea?

====

*EXERCISE*

`memset` your stack-allocated block arrays right after they have been declared:

----
memset(icache_blocks, 0, N_BLOCKS(icache) * sizeof(struct block));
memset(dcache_blocks, 0, N_BLOCKS(dcache) * sizeof(struct block));
memset(l2cache_blocks, 0, N_BLOCKS(l2cache) * sizeof(struct block));
----

Remember to include `<string.h>` at the top of your `sim.c`.

*Mental exercise*: Why do we need to multiply the number of blocks by
`sizeof(struct block)`? Why can't we just say e.g. `sizeof(icache_blocks)`?

====

Similarly to the block arrays, we want to stack-allocate the data arrays.

====

*EXERCISE*

1. Declare a macro `N_BYTES` which given a cache translates to the total
number of bytes storable in the cache. That is, the number of blocks, times
the number of words per block, times the number of bytes per word. 

2. Declare three data array as we declared the block arrays.

3. Set the data pointers in the three caches to point to these
stack-allocated arrays before proceeding with the rest of `interp`.

*Mental exercise*: Do we need to 0-initialize the data arrays or is it okay
that they contain garbage?

====

There is now a lot of initialization going on in `interp`. Some of it must
happen in `interp`, such as the declaration of the block and data arrays.
The rest, i.e. `memset` and assigning pointers can be abstracted away into
some sort of a `cache_init` function in the `mem` module:

====

*REFACTORING EXERCISE*

1. Declare a function `cache_init` in `mem.h`:

  int cache_init(struct cache *cache,
    struct block *blocks, unsigned char *data);

2. Implement the function `cache_init` in `mem.c`.

3. Call `cache_init` for each of the three caches in `interp` after
declaring the block and data arrays.

4. Clean up your includes in `sim.c`, and make sure to include `<string.h>`
in your `mem.c`. Make sure that everything compiles.

====

== Using the Caches

This part is intentionally left unguided.

====

*EXERCISE*

Modify `inst_read`, `data_read` and `data_write` to read or write addresses
via the caches. You should implement a two-level cache hierarchy, such that
e.g. if the address is not in the instruction cache, it is looked up in the
level-two shared cache, only if it is also not in the shared cache, it is
looked up in the memory.

You should implement a write-back writing strategy, with a random
replacement strategy.

Remember to mark every cache hit and miss, and change your `show_status` to
report the hits and misses as specified in <<_assignment>>.

Hints:

* You might want to define macros for set and tag calculations.

* You might want to define a `find_in_set` function to iterate over the
  blocks in a set, looking for a block with a matching tag.

====

== Completely Optional: Extensions

1. We implemented a write-back strategy for all caches. Add support for an
extra option at the end of the cache configuration line to further specify
if a write-through, or write-through with a write-buffer writing strategy
should be used instead. Your simulator should still work as above, without
the option.

2. Implement a LRU replacement strategy instead of random.

3. Is there a better, more cache-coherent memory layout for the caches? If
you find one, try to implement it.

== Submitting Your Solution

Follow these steps to submit your solution.

=== Finalize Your Solution

Clean up your code, remove superfluous code, and add comments for the
non-trivial parts.

Write a *short* report (`g3-report.txt` or `g3-report.pdf`) documenting your
solution. Discuss what works, what doesn't, if anything. Discuss the design
decisions you have had to make, if any. To back your claims, test with the
handed out test programs, and add your own. Discuss your tests in your report.

Your report should be sufficient to get a good idea of the extent and quality
of your implementation. **Your code will only be used to verify the claims you
make in your report**.

=== Package Your Code

Use the `tar` command-line utility to package your code:

----
~/ark$ tar cvzf g3-code.tar.gz 3rd
----

=== Submit on Absalon

Submit *two files* on Absalon:

. Your report (`g3-report.txt` or `g3-report.pdf`)
. Your archive (`g3-code.tar.gz`)

Remember to *mark your team members* on Absalon.
